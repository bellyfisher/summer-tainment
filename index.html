    <p class="card-text">Isabel is a hardworking individual, who takes time out of her day to commit to all of us in the band as a whole. Many of us look up to and highly respect her, since she's helped keep us from falling apart and keeping the band in time.<br>Similar to our student executive, she helps keep situations diffused before they can reach the point to where Mr. Ippolito has to get involved.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Harrison is also a hardworking individual, who makes all of us as a whole band laugh even in our stressful times, including our directors! Besides his sense of humor, he's a great drum major and has a perfect amount of seriousness in his presence. He's great at what he does, and I'm sure many people (me included) want to be like him if and when they audition for the drum major posiiton. Once I saw his conducting during the leadership team workshops, I knew he had a great chance at becoming drum major, and I'm really happy for him that he got it.</p>

<h6>Ashritha is a great student executive! I'm not saying this just because I've known her since first grade, but because she truly tracks down every situation that's happening in the band, no matter what kind of situation, and diffuses it before it can escalate to the point where the drum majors or directors have to get involved.<br>She also helps make sure everyone in the band is in the know if and when Ippolito says something that everybody in the band needs to know.<br>She's great at what she does, and she totally deserved the position since before leadership auditions even started.</h6>
